# Setting

Although the world of Arianus is a material plane, it is strongly influenced by the Plane of Air - islands floating in an airy sky. Maybe it is on the Plane of Air, maybe it's a demi-plane, maybe it's a fantasy gas giant. Doesn't really matter, and I like that there's no answer...yet, at least.

**What about the day and night cycle?**  
From the book, *Dragon Wing*, I'm stealing some ideas:

- The Firmament is a layer of glittering, star-like rocky bodies visible at night.
- Solaris is Arianus' sun, maybe a portal to the plane of positive energy?
- Lord of Night is a large body that orbits Solaris, eclipsing for around 12 hours a day, hence normal day and night cycle (but no seasons?).
- No moon, just the Firmament visible at night.

**What's below?**  
The Maelstrom, a permanent storm. No one who has ventured in has returned.

**Can people see the Maelstrom?**  
No, atmospheric obscuration prevents seeing that distance. People just see endless sky. Looking up, it's lighter, and the mysterious light of Solaris shines down. Looking down, the sky becomes a darker shade of blue. Perhaps if someone were to travel (fall?) far enough down, they might see a massive storm, like the eye of Jupiter.

**Can people see other celestial bodies?**  
Not usually, unless the are very close. Again, atmospheric obscuration prevents visibility. Although islands sometimes drift close to each other, measurements are typically in tens or hundreds of miles.

**How do people travel between islands?**  
Spelljamming ships, flying creatures or teleportation. For most people, travel to other islands is a distant dream. Merchants and navies are the most likely to travel, followed by diplomats. Spellcasters are needed to power ships, and navigators and navigation charts are essential to avoid collisions. No FTL travel, though. May develop spelljammer travel rules later.

**Which nations are there?**  
Most nations are organised into city-states. One group has organised into a league, while at least one (Dorenei) has a monarchy. A large empire of allied tribes that dwells on the lower realms is slowly mustering, too.

**Why is water scarce?**  
The weather is static compared to many worlds, and precipitation is rare. With little land to capture water, the people of Arianus have come up with novel solutions. These include reservoirs, dams and underground cisterns, but even with these, water is an important-and expensive-resource.
