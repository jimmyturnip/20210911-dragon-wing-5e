## Setup

Zothao must enter the lair of the Iron Hand and rescue his friend, Tzin.






## Scene 1
**Setup**: Zothao enters the Iron Hand's lair.  
**Altered/Interrupted**: [Open, rumour] Zothao goes to the Iron Hand's rumoured headquarters, though he's not sure if it's truly where they're based.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Will Zothao find the lair and his friend?  

    Where is the Iron Hand's lair rumoured to be? [Neglect, jealousy] An abandoned warehouse on the docks.

Zothao has lived on Dandrak long enough to know about the Iron Hand and their activities. They are said to operate out of an abandoned warehouse on the docks.

He decides to wait until nightfall, when the light of Solaris is eclipsed by the Lord of Night. Under the cover of darkness, he has a better chance of sneaking in unnoticed.

    When he gets to the warehouse, are there signs of activity (50%)? 49. Yes.  
    What's going on? [Abuse, advice]

As he watches from a nearby alley, a group of rough-looking thugs drag a figure with them. In the dim light, Zothao recognises the genasi he was speaking to earlier in the day. Is he here because of that conversation? They go through the side entrance - a small door - and Zothao looks around for lookouts.

    Zothao makes a Wisdom (Perception) +2 check, let's say DC 12. 13. Success.  
    Are there any lookouts (50%)? 33.

Just as he's about to move out, he sees a figure on the roof shift. Someone's up there, probably keeping an eye on the streets below. Zothao waits a few moments. Finally, the figure moves away from its vantage point. The half-orc seizes the moment and lightly pads over to the side entrance that the group went through. When he reaches the door, he takes a moment to listen.

    Wisdom (Perception) +2 vs DC 12. 21. Success.  
    Does he hear anything on the other side of the door (50%)? 20.  
    NOTE: Just realised I rolled an event earlier with the 33, so let's have it take place here.  
    [PC positive, debase, trials]. Can't think of anything. [Move, ambush]

He listens.

> UNKNOWN SPEAKER  
> You two. Keep an eye on things up here. We'll put the genasi with the other prisoner.

Two thugs. Zothao's training has focused on peace and serenity, but he knows he can handle himself when required. This might just be that time. He waits another couple of minutes. He grabs a handful of grit from the nearby ground, and slowly starts throwing pebbles one-by-one at the door. Before long, he hears a voice.

> UNKNOWN SPEAKER  
> What the bloody hell's that?

The door opens. Zothao strikes.

    Zothao makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check vs the **bandit's** passive Perception of 10. 12. Success.
    What's the bandit's race? (d10) 1 dwarf, 2 elf, 3 halfling, 4 human, 5 dragonborn,  
    6 gnome, 7 half-elf, 8 half-orc, 9 tiefling, 0 other.
    Get 7, half-elf.
    What's the bandit's gender? (d6) 1-3 male, 4-5 female, 6 non-binary/trans. 6 non-binary.

He grabs the half-elf by the scruff of the neck and covers their mouth before they can cry for help.

    Let's call this a grapple. Make contested Strength (Athletics) checks (+0 vs +0).  
    Zothao gets 14, the half-elf gets 16.

Lord of Night! The half-elf twists themself out of Zothao's grasp.

    COMBAT  
    Initiative: Zothao 23, Half-Elf Bandit 19 (13 hp)

    ROUND 1  
    Zothao draws his shortsword and attacks. +6 vs AC 12. 16. Hits for 9 (1d6+4) damage. Bandit is down to 4 hp.  
    Does the bandit try to fight (50%)? 99, exceptional no, plus event [NPC action, gratify, prison]  
    Bandit disengages and calls for help

Zothao's blade flashes in the dim reflected light of a lantern. He opens a nasty cut across the bandit's chest, and they step back, shouting a warning into the darkness.

    Does the second bandit join the fight (75%)? 29. Yes.  
    What's the second bandit's race and gender? 9 tiefling, 5 female.

    Initiative: Zothao 23, Half-Elf Bandit 19 (4 hp), Tiefling Bandit 10 (8 hp)

    ROUND 2  
    Zothao attacks the half-elf bandit with a dart. +6 vs AC 12. 20. Hits for 5 damage. Out.
    He rushes in to engage the second bandit.
    Second bandit attacks. +3 vs AC 16. 17. Hits for 4 (1d6+1) damage.

In the dim light beyond the door, Zothao sees that a second bandit is preparing to fight. Thinking quickly, he draws a dart from his belt and throws it at the half-elf. They go down with a groan of pain. Zothao rushes in, but the second bandit, a tiefling woman, has time to draw a wicked-looking scimitar and attack. A stain of blood expands across his right shoulder where the blade penetrates.

    ROUND 3  
    Zothao tries to stab at the woman. +6 vs AC 12. 14. Hits for 6 damage. Tiefling is down to 2 hp.
    Does the tiefling run? Make a Wisdom saving throw. +0 vs DC 10. 18. Yes.
    The tiefling disengages.

Zothao retaliates with his own blade, and scores an unpleasant wound of the tiefling's arm. She cries out, dances around his next blow, and runs deeper into the warehouse.





## Scene 2
**Setup**: Zothao stalks the tiefling into the warehouse.   
**Altered/Interrupted**: [Create, danger] Zothao follows the tiefling into a trap.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Will Zothao survive the trap?

Fool, fool, fool! Allowing the tiefling to escape was a big mistake. Zothao follows her through into the next, much larger area of the warehouse.

    Use Terrain Randomizer by Jos√© Manuel Navarro.
    Area is Large.
    6 (1d6) zones: 1-small, 4-medium, 1-small, 5-medium, 2-medium, 5-medium
    3 (1d3) elevation levels

NOTE: See [Warehouse Map](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/dragon-wing-5e/blob/master/warehouse-terrain-randomizer.jpg) for drop-dice map of the warehouse. Red circles indicate elevation (1=ground level, 2=10-20 feet, 3=40 feet).

    01 Oct 21: No time to do any more over the last two weeks, so glad to get back into it.

    What is the lighting situation in the warehouse? Is it dark (85%)? 15. Yes.

The warehouse is pitch black, but Zothao's natural darkvision allows him to see the outlines of shapes. Above him, nets containing sacks and boxes hang, suspended by tracks on the high ceiling. Stacks of shelves contain crates haphazardly stacked.
