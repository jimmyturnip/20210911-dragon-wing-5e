## Setup

The gods giveth, and the gods taketh away: Zothao's friend, Tzin, has gone missing. Meanwhile, Zothao has been tasked with welcoming a new arrival to the monastery.

## Scene 1
**Setup**: Zothao waits the arrival of the new initiate

**Altered/Interrupted**: [Divide, the spiritual] Zothao awaits the arrival of the new initiate at the port, a few kilometres from the monastery.

**What's fun about this scene**: Just exploring Zothao's world and the protocols and atmosphere of the monastery.

Yreni Docks, Isle of Dandrak. Zothao afraid of the docks. Doesn't like people. Doesn't like how close he is to the edge of the rock. What if he fell? What would it be like? He feels queasy, and attempts to meditate, take his mind off it. Minutes pass. Then hours. A young dockworker brings him a bowl of water, to which Zothao expresses his gratitude. Water. The most precious resource on Arianus. Islands of earth floating in an endless sky. Rain is rare, and not a single drop of water can be wasted.

    How late is the transport? Is it more than a day (50%)? 57. No.

The transport was due to arrive early morning, but it is mid-afternoon by the time the lookout ring the bell to indicate the approach of the vessel. By the time it is visible, it is already quite close to the island.

    What kind of transport is it? [Attract, bureaucracy] I'd say it's a ship.
    Where is it coming from? [Starting, messages] A hub, perhaps the capital of this nation.
    Any interesting details about the vessel? I'd like to use some spelljammer vessels, so roll:
        1. dragonfly
        2. hammership
        3. squidship
        4. tradesman
        5. galleon
        6. longship
    Get 2. Hammership.

The ship aligns with the isle's plane, and glides towards the dock. A hammership. Military? Surprising. What kind of person is this?

As the ship nears the jetty, the sounds of barked orders can be heard. Eventually, it pulls in. The gangplank is lowered, and a line of people begins to descend onto the dock.

    Who is the visitor? Use the Character Crafter from *Mythic Adventure Crafter*.  
    Special Trait: 51. Member of an organisation.  
    Identity: 40. Administrator.  
    Descriptors: 92. Hurt.  
    I'll say it's a member of royalty who's been sent to the monastery to recover from an injury or illness.

Zothao stands proud, anxious not to represent the monastery in the best light possible, but also assert his authority to this new initiate, a junior member of Dorinei, the capital city's, royalty.

People stream past him, but none of them give him a second look. Has he missed them? No. He groans inwardly as the last people off the ship carry a palanquin. Ah. So this is the new initiate. A royal scion so delicate that they can't even walk themselves off a boat. Just his luck.

## Scene 2

**Setup**: Zothao meets the new arrival

**Altered/Interrupted**: No

**What's fun about this scene**: Finding out who this person is and interacting with them.

Zothao moves to greet the palanquin.

    What's the name of this person? Tenfrith.

> ZOTHAO  
> Prince Tenfrith, I presume? Welcome to Dendrak. I am Zothao, brother of the...

    What's Zothao's order called? [Usurp, suffering] Order of the Consummate Sorrow.

> ZOTHAO  
> ...Consummate Sorrow. I am here to escort you to the monastery.

    How does Prince Tenfrith react? [Kill, the mundane]
    What is he like? Poor. Maybe ill?

Zothao hears a weak, but cheerful voice from within the palanquin.

> TENFRITH  
> Zothao! Yes, I am indeed Tenfrith. Thank you, my journey has been long.

There's a pause as a phlegmy cough erupts from inside.

> TENFRITH  
> Please, do not put on airs and graces for me. Let me look at you.

The faint silhouette of a figure, obscured by the gossamer curtains of the palanquin, leans forward.

Zothao is slender but sinewy after years of physical training and labour. His head is shaven, but he sports a long black beard.

    What about his monk's robes? [Decrease, the public].

He wears the standard white linen hooded poncho and trousers typical of his order. Flagrant displays of the body are discouraged among the followers of the Consummate Sorrow.

> TENFRITH  
> Would you lower your hood?

> ZOTHAO  
> I... I'm afraid that is forbidden in public, Prince.

He hesitates to use the correct form of address. If the prince is to be an initiate, he must relinquish any past titles or binds to the world, just as Zothao did.

> TENFRITH  
> Of course, forgive me.

> ZOTHAO  
> If you will follow me. The monastery is some distance from the town. We have something of a walk ahead of us.

The guards carrying the palanquin follow behind Zothao as he leads them through the town and out into the surrounding pasturelands.

Monastery of the Consummate Sorrow. Zothao has been tasked with supervising Tenfrith's catechumanship.

	| What exactly are they doing right now? [Judge, illness] They are talking about Tenfrith's health.

> ZOTHAO  
> But wouldn't you have been better looked after at court, in your own home? Surely, your family would have servants who could help you.

> TENFRITH  
> Well, first of all, my friend, I don't need to be "looked after", at least not as much as you think. Secondly, the palace is not safe at the moment. The royal family has many enemies. Every time you turn a corner, there could be a knife with your name on it. At least here, I'll be taught how to fight back.

> ZOTHAO  
> We learn to fight in order to perfect the body and defend the weak. That means you.

> TENFRITH  
>  Zothao, I may look weak, but I don't need helping. How many times do I have to tell you   this.

> ZOTHAO  
> Actions speak louder, Prince. You can barely walk.

> TENFRITH  
> Tell me, my friend. Can a man plough a field bare-handed?

> ZOTHAO  
> Well, I... I suppose he could, given enough time.

> TENFRITH  
> But it would be difficult. He might cut himself on a rock, no?

> ZOTHAO  
> Yes...

> TENFRITH  
> And it would take a long time. Much longer than using the correct tool. No?

> ZOTHAO  
> Yes, but...

> TENFRITH  
> And so it is with me. I may not be able to walk perfectly. I may not even be able to fight. But with the appropriate tools and support, I can manage just as well as anyone else.

> ZOTHAO  
> There is wisdom in what you say.

> TENFRITH  
> Of course there is. I'm the prince!

Zothao grunts. The chirurgeon continues her work, poking and prodding Tenfrith's limbs.

*/

Dorenei. The treasury keeper's tower. Monteflore bows slightly.

> MONTEFLORE  
> Your Grace.

The knight squints in the dimness of the treasure keeper's chamber. The treasure keeper himself sits behind his desk. The chamber smells of incense and must.

> ATHEPPIO  
> I trust your errand was successful.

The rings on his fingers glint in the dim light.

> MONTEFLORE  
> Indeed. The prince has arrived on Dandrak. I do not believe he suspects me, your grace.

> ATHEPPIO  
> Good. Very good. The prince must not leave that island alive. See to it.

> MONTEFLORE  
> Your Grace, what we're doing... I... I have doubts, I must confess. Is it really...

The treasury keeper raises his hand.

> ATHEPPIO  
> Hush, my son. I understand your feelings. The weight of this task bears heavily on us all. But we must remember why we are here, the greater purpose. The royal house is on a course that will lead to the ruin of Dorenei. Actions must be taken that may not be the most... pleasant. But taken they must be. Have faith, my son. Soon, Dorenei's course will be corrected, and we will emerge a nation stronger than ever before.

    Does Atheppio convince Monteflore? Charisma (Persuasion) +7, DC 12. 13. Success, just about.

The knight nods.

> MONTEFLORE  
> Yes, your Grace. I am wrong to doubt. Have no fear. Your will be done.

Atheppio gestures, meeting concluded. As Monteflore steps out, he pauses, ever so briefly at the door, but continues on his way, resolved to the task he must now fulfil.
