## Setup

Zothao searches for Tzin.





## Scene 1
**Setup**: Zothao asks around the monastery about Tzin  
**Altered/Interrupted**: Zothao asks around town about Tzin  
**What's fun about this scene**: Investigation?  

Yreni, Dandrak Isle. Besides the monastery, Dandrak has a large lake and plenty of flat pasture land, and serves as an important bread basket for the Kingdom of Dorenei. Yreni is the main port and largest town for the isle. Lady Eray is the nominal ruler of the isle, but often bows to the will of Vathras, the abbot of the Consummate Sorrow monastery.

    Where would Zothao most likely start his investigation? In the barracks (50%)? 34. Yes.  
    Are the guards friendly to Zothao (50%)? 72. No.  
    Why not? [Waste, disruption] They resent Zothao's intrusion into their private time.  

Zothao's outline at the door, framed in light. Guards sit around a mess hall table. It's midday. The guard who admitted Zothao speaks.

> GUARD 1  
> Go on, then. Ask.

Zothao clears his throat.

> ZOTHAO  
> I'm looking for Tzin. Anyone seen him?

    Does anyone respond (35%)? 35. Yes.
    Have they seen Tzin (50%)? 61. No.
    Do they tell the truth (35%)? 32. Yes.

No one responds initially. Zothao looks at the guards in frustration. His voice booms over them.

> ZOTHAO  
> I said, has anyone seen Tzin?

    Let's make a Charisma (Intimidate) +3 check vs DC 12. 15. Success.

> GUARD 2  
> Alright, brother. Keep your robes under control. I ain't seen 'im. Anyone else?

Guards mutter, but no one speaks up.

> GUARD 2  
> Didn't show up for his shift this morning. Lazy bastard. Cap'n'll have him one of these days. You a friend of his? Try his house. Maybe he'll be there.

Zothao looks concerned, but nods in appreciation. He turns and leaves, sure the guards are swearing behind his back.





## Scene 2
**Setup**: Zothao heads to Tzin's house.  
**Interrupted**: [Take, advice] The guard who admitted Zothao has a quiet word with him.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Hopefully, some new information about Tzin.  

As he's leaving the barracks, the guard who admitted him clasps Zothao's arm.

    What info do they have about Tzin? [Fight, bureaucracy]. Some administrative entanglement.

> GUARD 1  
> I saw him a couple of days ago. Said he was having trouble at the courier's office. They were refusing to send a message he'd written. Something like that. Might want to try there.

Zothao expresses thanks and moves along. So, the courier's office. That could only mean one thing...





## Scene 3
**Setup**: Zothao heads to the courier's office.  
**Altered**: [Waste, the innocent] Zothao heads to the courier's office, but also pays some street kids to watch out for Tzin.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Maybe finding out what kind of message Tzin is trying to send.  

The courier's office is near the docks, and as Zothao arrives, a gang of street kids squat over a game. He flips one a coin and tells them to look out for Tzin. (Yreni's not that big - they probably know who he is).

In the courier's office, Zothao approaches the figure sitting at a scribe's desk.

    What race are they? (d10) 1 dwarf, 2 elf, 3 halfling, 4 human, 5 dragonborn,  
    6 gnome, 7 half-elf, 8 half-orc, 9 tiefling, 0 other.  
    I roll 0, so other. Let's say they're an air genasi - that'd be fitting for this setting.  
    Let's roll on the Adventure Crafter's character crafter tables.  
    Descriptors: Colourful, gentle  
    Name: Manse  
    Has Zothao met Manse before (50%)? 88. No.
