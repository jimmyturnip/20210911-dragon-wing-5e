**Personality Traits**:

- I idolise a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.
- Also, I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.

**Ideal**: I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well.

**Bond**: I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.

**Flaw**: I put too much trust in those who wield power within the temple's hierarchy.
